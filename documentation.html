        I didn't start with building a responsive grid system. Matter of fact, I didn't even have responsivity in mind. I was thinking about a way to turn sections of the page into 3D objects. <br>
        
        hovering above an element with your mouse would make it 3D, by appplying a drop-shadow & lighter background-color to the element.<br>
        <br>

        Luckily, When I got back home and started working on it. <br>
        It worked just as I intended <br>
        <br>
        
        Hovering would make the element appear 3D by being lighter than the rest and having a minimal drop-shadow on the left + the added benefit of having a trail animation made the grid element rise and fall gracefully. <br>
        <br>
        
        There was a problem though. <br>
        <br>

        While reviewing and playing with the grid system: tuning the colors and drop shadow. <br>
        I tried moving the browser to another monitor for better inspection. <br>
        That's when I realised My original javascript function had only one screen width in mind, <br>
        I never thought about the other screen types, and how they would react to my grid. <br>
        <br>

        That's when I set out to write, what at first seemed to be a fairly simple function, my bane for a couple of hours, <br>
        and the reason I began to hate the "height" property ever since.
